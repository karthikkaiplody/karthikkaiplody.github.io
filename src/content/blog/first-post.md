# Welcome

I decided to revamp my portfolio to make it cleaner, faster, and easier to update. 
I used **Astro** for the framework and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Why Astro?

Astro is fantastic for content-focused websites. It ships zero JavaScript to the client by default, making the site incredibly fast.

## Adding new posts

Now I can add new blog posts simply by creating a markdown file in the `src/content/blog` directory.

```markdown

Stay tuned for more updates on my projects and learnings in AI/ML!
