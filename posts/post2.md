One of the key aspects is ensuring that websites adapt gracefully to various screen sizes. This often involves using flexible grids, fluid images, and media queries.

Another important trend is the adoption of dark mode, which we've implemented in this portfolio. It can reduce eye strain and save battery life on some devices.

Here's an example of a simple CSS media query for responsiveness:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .some-element {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
```

User experience (UX) is paramount. This includes intuitive navigation, fast load times, and accessible content for everyone.
